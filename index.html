          <p>HTML is always the base coding to any website. Also, it can be used to implement a variety of other types of code, one of these are CSS. For the CSS to be incorporated you must use one (or more) of the listed methods:</p>
					<xmp style="font-family: Roboto;">
    •Internal
    •Inline
    •External
					</xmp><br>
					<p>Internal - This is when the code is written within the "head" of a web page. If used, the entire page can be changed, although this could be a disadvantage for the reason thta it may take up a larger file size compared to the other methods.</p><br>

          <p>Inline - To many this is considered as the easiest and simplest form of adding a style, because the CSS is applied directly to a HTML tag. To change a CSS style, one would require to access the HTML and search the file for the style attribute however, causing difficulty in this situation.</p><br> 
          <p>External - External is my preferred method for the reason that it can contain all code neatly in a separate file (most commonly called "mystyle.css" or "stylesheet.css") with a ".css" on the end. From that point on the user will have the ability to identify different segments, or individual pieces, and then edit it's color, position, and more!</p>

          <p>The CSS Box Model is the main layout of almost all webpages. Using a CSS box model will allow the user to space out different objects from one another. Additionally, padding can be added to an object, creating the object to stand out more, or a border can be used instead for the same purpose. Lastly, a margin can be added to the website to prevent text, photos, and other content, from flowing off of the main page.</p><br>
          <p>Content - This is held within the centre of the box model and contains the main information, like text and images, that are to be seen by the public</p><br>
          <p>Padding - Padding is used as an invisible barrier to prevent objects like text and images from interferring and contacting with each other</p><br>
          <p>Border - The Border is placed around the padding to add a bit more creativity to a website, if the developer chooses to do so</p><br>
          <p>Margin - Lastly, the margin is a clear space around everything which serves the purpose of ensureing that all text and other content can be viewed without it slipping off to the side</p>

          <p>Scripting can be a big advantage in creating many websites as it allows the user to interact with the website, or it can create a run-time program. However, learning Java(or other scripting languages) can be very time consuming and fustrating to many.</p><br>
					<p>Variables are a statistical value that can be used to make programs for the website. Relevent to the program running, the variable may always change, and if so this could be turned into an add-on for a website to be better optimised, or be made easily accessible, for everyone. Here is an example of a variable being set: "var sum1 = 3;".</p><br>
          <p>A function is used to carry out the purpose of a allowing users to gain results from completing tasks. This can range anywhere from a button click to entering a 4-digit password. This means that it can be related to event driven programming by a large amount.</p>
          <p>Another commonly used script in web design are loops. With the use of a loop the user can make it continuously repeats any process until the stated end goal has been met.</p><br>
